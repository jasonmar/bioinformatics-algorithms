## Description

This project is organized into packages named for chapters of the source textbook.

Do not use this repository to cheat.

## Motivation

Bioinformatics algorithms offer many chances to demonstrate how standard Scala collections can be used to implement algorithms in a concise and hopefully easy to understand way that often closely matches the documentation.

## Features

Unit testing: some of the problems have tests created using ScalaTest - look for files suffixed with "Spec.scala" in src/test/scala/bioinf/
